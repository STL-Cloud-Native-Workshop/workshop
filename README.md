# Cloud Native Workshop
Primary repository for Cloud Native Development workshop.

## Description
Want to learn Cloud Native Development from concept to execution but don't know where to start? Need to sink your hands into it under expert tutelage? This workshop is for you.

In this guided lab, we will start by explaining the following key concepts:

* 12 (or so) Factor Apps: A Starting Point
* The Evolution of Cloud Native Development
* Microservices Architectures: A Smart Fit

Once you understand the foundational concepts, it's time to put that knowledge to use. We'll help you build your Cloud Native knowledge & practical experience as you:

* Create a self-contained, cloud-executable Java application
* Create a code repository for your program
* Configure your application's environment for portability
* Connect to backing services as resources (microservices)
* Make it stateless, "share nothing" for scalability and reliability (microservices)
* Create and expose an endpoint, making your app a backing (micro)service
* Deploy to the cloud, then test disposability/robustness
* Examine monitoring and logging capabilities

Each exercise performed will be shown in context so attendees learn and internalize the why _and_ how of Cloud Native development practices.
